    \title Qt Insight Tracker
    \brief Provides Qt Insight Tracker.

    Qt Insight is an analytics solution designed to provide real customer
    insights on the usage of your application or device. It was created for
    companies utilizing embedded technology to shed light on an applicationâ€™s
    performance, usage, and user data that may not be otherwise attainable.

    Qt Insight Tracker provides C++ and QML APIs to track application usage
    through events and send the analytic data to a
    \l{https://www.qt.io/product/insight}{Qt Insight} back-end server.

    \section1 Using the Module

    Using a Qt module requires linking against the module library, either
    directly or through other dependencies. Several build tools have dedicated
    support for this, including CMake and qmake.

    To import the QML types into your application, use the following import statement
    in your .qml file:

    \qml
    import QtInsightTracker
    \endqml

    \section2 Building with CMake

    Use the \c find_package() command to locate the needed module components in
    the Qt6 package:

    \badcode
    find_package(Qt6 REQUIRED COMPONENTS InsightTracker)
    target_link_libraries(mytarget PRIVATE Qt::InsightTracker)
    \endcode

    See also the \l{Build with CMake} overview.

    \section2 Building with qmake

    To configure the module for building with qmake, add the module as a value
    of the QT variable in the project's .pro file:

    \badcode
    QT += insighttracker
    \endcode
